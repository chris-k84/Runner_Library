## Motivation

This started out as an XTS library, then became something else, a huge crawling repo with too much stuff doing too many things. So it's been broken up into numerous libraries which will break out the elements into modules which align in function and intent. Basically the motivation is to have a clue whats going on :-) 

## The Goal

The goal of this repo is to build on the base repo, using the cyclic modules to create an object specifically to run a modular system. This module will call all the cyclic logic of all registered objects and handle initialisation.
